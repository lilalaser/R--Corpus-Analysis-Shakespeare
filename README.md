# R--Corpus-Analysis-Shakespeare
This project analyzes the use of second-person pronouns ("thou/thee" vs. "you/ye") in Shakespeare's plays to explore sociolinguistic patterns. It identifies which plays feature more instances of the familiar pronoun relative to the formal one and examines which characters are most likely to use each form.
